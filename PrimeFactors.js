/* Factor into two prime numbers

Hints:
* The two numbers will be roughly the same size
* A 50 bit number will yield two roughly 25 (Â± 1) bit prime factors

Strategy:
* Cycle through set of primes within that region
* Multitly ones digit of two numbers and compare to product's ones digit
* Speed up the process of checking all the primes
* It's very inefficient to calculate large numbers primes
* Factoring is also intractible making it a very useful element of cryptography
